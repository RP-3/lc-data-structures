# Data Structures
Data structures that:
1) Do not exist natively in Javascript
2) Are handy for online assessments used in hiring and on platforms like Leetcode

Structures themselves have no dependencies and are typically << 100 SLOC.

# Usage
1. Compile it yourself (see `install` and `compile`)
2. Copy and paste the built JS

## Install (dev dependencies)
- `npm i`

## Compile
- `npm run build`

## Incremental compiler
- `npm run watch`

## Test
- `npm test`

## Test & report coverage
